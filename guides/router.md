# Router

Portal liveviews behave differently from regular liveviews. You might want your Phoenix application to host both types.

## Portal pipeline

First, let's build a new `Phoenix.Router.pipeline/2` in our router only for portals. In `MyAppWeb.Router` we have the
following:

```elixir
pipeline :portal do
  plug :accepts, ["html"]
  plug :fetch_session
  plug :fetch_live_flash
  plug :protect_from_forgery
  plug :put_secure_browser_headers
end
```

The only special thing that we do here is not including the root layout here. The rest is the same as the default
generated by Phoenix. This is because the portal will live in another DOM, so we should not define a new `<head>`.

## Portal scope

Now, let's route paths inside `/portal` through our newly created pipeline:

```elixir
  scope "/portal", MyAppWeb do
    pipe_through :portal

    live "/initial", Views.Initial
  end
```

Here we define the `Phoenix.LiveView.Router.live/4` that routes our portal.

Let's move on to the [Endpoint configuration](endpoint.html).
